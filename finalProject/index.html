    <h1>Author Guidelines</h1>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in publishing with us. We accept submissions in Arabic, French and English. We primarily publish the following types of article. However, if you have something you feel is suitable for the Beirut Art Review that doesn’t quite fit these, please feel free to contact the editors at beirutartreview@aub.edu.lb.</p>
    <h2>What We Publish</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Reviews</h3>
            <p>Reviews should provide an overview of the event/exhibition, consider the claims or arguments made by the artworks/artist/curatorial decisions, and evaluate successes or failures. While it is essential that the review provide a critically engaged assessment of the event, it should also be consistent with maintaining a collegial dialogue.</p>
            <p>Reviews can be up to two thousand (2,000) words, inclusive of footnotes and bibliography. Images are particularly important for reviews, and we encourage authors to include up to ten (10) images to support their work.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Articles</h3>
            <p>Articles should be original work that presents historically or theoretically informed insights into artwork(s) or issues relevant to the artistic world of Beirut, the region or the diaspora. Articles may be up to six thousand (6,000) words, inclusive of footnotes.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Dialogues</h3><p>Dialogues are intended to support discussion about art and critique. We accept interviews and reply essays.</p><p>Interviews should be with individuals relevant to and impacting the artistic world of Beirut, the region or the diaspora (eg. artists, curators, art collectives, collectors, etc).</p><p>A ‘reply’ essay responds to work published in Beirut Art Review or other art publications. The purpose of the reply is to further or deepen discussion of the topic at issue (rather than to simply refute a differing opinion). Replies are generally short, 500-1000 words, inclusive of footnotes and bibliography.</p><p>Authors interested in submitting a reply or interview should contact the editors at beirutartreview@aub.edu.lb before submission.</p>
